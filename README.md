## Course Objective:

I am on a journey to master JavaScript by learning and solving real-world problems. This journey continues from where my introductory JavaScript course concluded. My goal is to utilize a wide range of JavaScript programming strategies to construct interactive programs. I am keen to delve into topics such as object-oriented programming, unit testing, asynchronous executions, files and streams, lambda expressions, and module bundlers. I am eager to emphasize problem-solving using advanced JavaScript techniques.
